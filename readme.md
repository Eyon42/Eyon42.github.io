# This is my blog made with jekyll

I'm posting here every Thursday.

Ignore the rest of this readme.

## To-Do:
    - Start next week post (Maybe about how to set-up Brownie in Vs Code)
    - Add multilingual support
    - Translate posts
    - Write project posts for previous projects

## Run instructions
```
$ gem install bundler jekyll
$ bundle install
$ npm install // for tailwind css
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --livereload
```
add `-D` flag for drafts
