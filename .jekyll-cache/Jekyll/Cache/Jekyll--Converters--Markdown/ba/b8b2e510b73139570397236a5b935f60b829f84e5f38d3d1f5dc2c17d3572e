I".<p>Recently i started to try and learn more songs on guitar by ear. An important part of doing that is learning which key is the song in. So I thought it would be useful to see the distribution of the notes in the song to figure that out.</p>

<p>I started looking up how could I get the note data. After looking at a bunch of different formats for storing music data I decided to first test with MIDI, as it is a pretty common format and had a <a href="https://mido.readthedocs.io/">well documented library</a>.</p>

<p>After some reading and exploring in a <a href="https://github.com/Eyon42/MIDI-Note-Analizer/blob/master/Music_analyzer.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a> i wrote a couple functions to extract the note data and count it. Then i plotted the result with <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>.</p>

<p>The MIDI files that I had for my first tests were exported from a Guitar Pro file. So I decided to add the posibility to get data from Guitar Pro Files directly and skip having to export each song manually. For this i used the <a href="https://pyguitarpro.readthedocs.io">PyGuitarPro</a> Library.</p>
