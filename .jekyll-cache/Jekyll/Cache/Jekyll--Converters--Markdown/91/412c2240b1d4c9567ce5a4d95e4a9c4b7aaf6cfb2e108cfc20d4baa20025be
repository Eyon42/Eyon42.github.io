I"Î<p>Iâ€™ve been playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons for about 2 years now. Itâ€™s a really fun game where the only limit is what you can imagine(And what the Dungeon Master(DM) allows). But even in such a world without limits, there must be some kind of order. The DM can have plans, notes and maps, but such things are worthless once your players decide to get creative and take a totally unexpected route. The player, on the other hand, has the Character Sheet.</p>
