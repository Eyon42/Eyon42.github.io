I"·<p>About three year ago FiveThirtyEight published a short article called <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-your-dd-character-rare/">â€œIs Your D&amp;D Character Rare?â€</a> which used a huge dataset of characters to make a table showing Class and race combinations per 100,000 characters created by players. Then a year later <a href="https://oganm.github.io/">Ogan Mancarci</a> remade the table and made a more in depth analysis using a dataset of 885 character sheets. In the present, two years later, this dataset has grown to over 6000 character sheets. So my intention now is to recreate parts of this analysis and add a bit of my own.
