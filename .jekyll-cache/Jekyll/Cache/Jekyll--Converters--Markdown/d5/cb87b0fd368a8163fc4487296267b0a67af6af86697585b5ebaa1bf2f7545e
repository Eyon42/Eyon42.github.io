I"<p>I started this project because i had to study for my final exam of mathematical analysis. I usually make big cheat sheets on paper with all the formulas and a summary of the concepts. But since this year I’ve been trying to make everything digital and keep no papers. Partly because i don’t really want to keep around all those papers but mostly because because the flexibility of a keyboard and a graphics tablet is unbeatable by paper. One of those advantages is the capacity to feed my notes into software to do stuff.</p>
