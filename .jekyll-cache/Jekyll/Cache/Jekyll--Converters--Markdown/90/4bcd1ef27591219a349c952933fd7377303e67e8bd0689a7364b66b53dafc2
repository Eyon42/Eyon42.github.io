I"t<p>Recently i started to try and learn more songs on guitar by ear, an important part of doing that is learning which key is the song in. So i thought it would be usefull to see the distribution of the notes in the song to figure that out.</p>

<p>I started looking up how could i get the note data and after looking at a bunch of different formats for storing music data I decided to first test with MIDI, as it is a pretty common format and had a <a href="https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Well Documented library</a>.</p>

<p>After some reading and exploring in a Jupyter Notebook i wrote a couple functions to extract the note data and count it. Then i plotted the result with <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a></p>

<p>Once i got that working i decided to expand a bit and add the posibility to get data from Guitar Pro Files directly, as the MIDI files i used were exported from gpt files. For this i used the <a href="https://pyguitarpro.readthedocs.io">PyGuitarPro</a> Library.</p>
